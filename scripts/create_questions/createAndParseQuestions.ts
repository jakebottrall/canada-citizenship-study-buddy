    ${JSON.stringify(examples)}
    You must use the following guidelines:
		- There may only be four options per question.
		- Each option's value is it's index position in the array.
		- The answer is the value of the correct option.
		- Only return the JSON object, nothing else.
		- Only use information from the page given to you, do not use any other sources.
		- Avoid using language that is not included on the provided page.
		- Do not use ambiguous questions. For example "What is the meaning of the Remembrance Day poppy?" is a good question, but "What is the meaning of the poppy?" is not.
		- Do not use ambiguous answers. For example "To remember the sacrifice of Canadians who have served or died in wars up to the present day" is a good answer, but "To remember the sacrifice of Canadians" is not.
